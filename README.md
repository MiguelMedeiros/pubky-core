## Overview

Pubky-core combines a [censorship resistant public-key based alternative to DNS](https://pkarr.org) with conventional, tried and tested web technologies, to keep users in control of their identities and data, while enabling developers to build software with as much availability as web apps, without the costs of managing a central database.

## Features
- Public key based authentication.
- Public key based 3rd party authorization.
- Key-value store through PUT/GET/DELET HTTP API + pagination.

## Getting started

> [!WARNING]  
> Pubky is still under heavy development and should be considered an alpha software.
> Features might be added, removed, or changed. Data might be lost.
