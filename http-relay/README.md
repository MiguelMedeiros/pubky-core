# HTTP Relay

A Rust implementation of _some_ of [Http relay spec](https://httprelay.io/).

Normally you are better off running the [reference implementation's binary](https://httprelay.io/download/).

This implementation, for the time being is meant for having a convenient library to be used in unit tests, and testnets in Pubky.
